There is always time for working out. Just look at Richard Simmons; what a motivating coach that guy was, always making time for you to get fit and have fun doing it. You could be 600 pounds, 80 years old, and on 20 medications; Richard could get you back into shape with his energetic bouncing and motivating voice telling you that you were worth how good you could feel. If they can do it, so can you! 
So, if you're ready to blast and tone, call the number in the picture.
